            <p>Anomaly detection is a critical data analysis technique employed to discern patterns or data points that markedly deviate from the expected or normal behavior within a dataset. Anomalies, often referred to as outliers or exceptions, can take various forms, such as unexpected spikes in numerical data, irregular patterns in time-series data, or outliers within multivariate datasets. These deviations may signify errors in data collection or processing, instances of fraud, system malfunctions, or other abnormal behaviors. As such, anomaly detection holds significant importance across diverse domains, including finance, cybersecurity, healthcare, and manufacturing. Utilizing statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, or domain-specific expertise, anomaly detection aims to differentiate between normal and anomalous data, facilitating early identification of potential risks and enabling proactive measures to address them. By leveraging anomaly detection techniques, organizations can enhance their ability to mitigate risks, strengthen security measures, and safeguard the integrity of their data assets.</p>
